# Maximum Bitwise XOR After Rearrangement

Can you solve this real interview question? Maximum Bitwise XOR After Rearrangement - You are given two binary strings s and t , each of length n.

You may rearrange the characters of t in any order, but s must remain unchanged.

Return a binary string of length n representing the maximum integer value obtainable by taking the bitwise XOR of s and rearranged t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "101", t = "011"

Output: "110"

Explanation:

 * One optimal rearrangement of t is "011".
 * The bitwise XOR of s and rearranged t is "101" XOR "011" = "110", which is the maximum possible.

Example 2:

Input: s = "0110", t = "1110"

Output: "1101"

Explanation:

 * One optimal rearrangement of t is "1011".
 * The bitwise XOR of s and rearranged t is "0110" XOR "1011" = "1101", which is the maximum possible.

Example 3:

Input: s = "0101", t = "1001"

Output: "1111"

Explanation:

 * One optimal rearrangement of t is "1010".
 * The bitwise XOR of s and rearranged t is "0101" XOR "1010" = "1111", which is the maximum possible.
