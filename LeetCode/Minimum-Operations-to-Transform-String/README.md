# Minimum Operations to Transform String

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Operations to Transform String - You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

 * Choose any character c in the string and replace every occurrence of c with the next lowercase letter in the English alphabet.

Return the minimum number of operations required to transform s into a string consisting of only 'a' characters.

Note: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus 'a' comes after 'z'.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "yz"

Output: 2

Explanation:

 * Change 'y' to 'z' to get "zz".
 * Change 'z' to 'a' to get "aa".
 * Thus, the answer is 2.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a"

Output: 0

Explanation:

 * The string "a" only consists of 'a' characters. Thus, the answer is 0.
